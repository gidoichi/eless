#+TITLE: Contributing Guide
#+AUTHOR: Kaushal Modi
This guide is for you if you'd like to do any of the below:
- Open an issue (plus provide debug information).
- Simply clone this repo and build =eless= locally.
- Do above + Provide a PR.
* How to help debug
- If you find =eless= not working as expected, file an [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/eless/issues][issue]].
- Include the following debug information:
  1. =emacs --version=
  2. =eless= debug info:
     - Append the =-D= option to your =eless= use case. Examples:
       - =eless foo -D=
       - =info org | eless -D=
     - If you are providing debug info for something like =man foo=, do
       - =PAGER=â€‹"eless -D" man foo=
* Development
** Preparation
This project builds *everything* from the =eless.org= file --- the
=eless= Bash script /plus/ all the [[https://kaushalmodi.github.io/eless/][HTML]], Info documentation,
=README.org=, =CONTRIBUTING.org=, and even the Wiki pages. So before
your proceed, you also need to:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cd docs/
git clone https://github.com/kaushalmodi/eless.wiki.git
#+END_SRC
** To build =eless= and documentation
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
make eless
#+END_SRC
*** Sanity check of the tangled =eless=
Run the tangled =eless= through [[http://www.shellcheck.net/][shellcheck]] to ensure that there are no
errors.
** To build documentation
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
make doc
#+END_SRC
*** Understand the changes
- The randomly generated hyperlinks and section numbers in the Info
  document and HTML will be different.
- Other than that, you shouldn't see any unexpected changes.
** Submitting PR
- You can submit a PR once you have reviewed all the changes in the
  tangled =eless= script and documentation.
- If changes are only to the Wiki, I believe you can push them
  directly using =git= or manually edit those [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/eless/wiki][here]]. /I have to yet
  figure out how to keep the non-git Wiki changes and changes in
  =eless.org= in sync./
