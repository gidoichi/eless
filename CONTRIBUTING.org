#+TITLE: Contributing Guide
#+AUTHOR: Kaushal Modi
This guide is for you if you'd like to do any of the below:
- Open an issue (plus provide debug information).
- Simply clone this repo and build =eless= locally.
- Do above + Provide a PR.
* How to help debug
- If you find =eless= not working as expected, file an [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/eless/issues][issue]].
- Include the following debug information:
  1. =emacs --version=
  2. =eless= debug info:
     - Append the =-D= option to your =eless= use case. Examples:
       - =eless foo -D=
       - =info org | eless -D=
     - If you are providing debug info for something like =man foo=, do
       - =PAGER=â€‹"eless -D" man foo=
* Development
** Dependencies
Here's a short list of dependencies if you would like to build =eless=
and the documentation from =eless.org=:

1. Org version 9.x -- Latest version of Org from Melpa or Org Elpa
2. =htmlize= package for syntax highlighting of code in html exports
   -- Melpa
3. =rainbow-delimiters= package for syntax highlighting of parenthese
   in elisp code in html exports -- Melpa

The recommended way is to run =emacs -Q= and then run =M-x
eless-install-dependencies= to install the dependencies in your
=temporary-file-directory=. /You can choose to even install these
manually in your emacs config if you like./

I used the latest emacs and org-mode versions built from their =master=
branches for this project. So if any of the below steps do not work
for you, open an issue!

Talking about dependencies, this project builds *everything* from
=eless.org= file, the =eless= script /plus/ all the HTML, Info
documentation, =README.org=, =CONTRIBUTING.org=, and even the Wiki
pages. So before running =M-x eless-build= mentioned in below build
steps, you also need to:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cd doc/
git clone https://github.com/kaushalmodi/eless.wiki.git
#+END_SRC
** Steps to build =eless= and documentation
- =emacs -Q=
- *First* open a non-org file like =build/build.el= and *evaluate it*.
  - The emphasis on opening a non-org file is so that the
    older-than-required version of =org= in =emacs -Q= doesn't get
    auto-loaded.  The next step would be to install newer version of
    org to a temp location. That step would fail due to mixed org
    versions if the default org version got loaded first.
  - Evaluating this file will now allow you to run =M-x
        eless-install-dependencies= or =M-x eless-build=.
- Do =M-x eless-install-dependencies=.
  - You will need to do this step only for the very first time you
    start working on this project.
- Do =M-x eless-build=.
- Run the tangled =eless= through [[http://www.shellcheck.net/][shellcheck]] to ensure that there are
  no errors.
- Understand the changes made in =eless=, /plus/ all the other files.
  - I build the HTML documentation using the Org version from =master=
    branch. So if you build the HTML documentation using the latest
    stable as of today (version =9.0.7=), your HTML export will look a
    bit different (absence of nested =<code>= blocks inside =<pre>=),
    but that's OK.
  - Also the randomly generated hyperlinks and section numbers (if you
    added/removed/moved documentation sections) will be different in
    the HTML and Info exports.
  - .. and the =git rev-parse= returned commit hash will be different.
  - Other than that, you shouldn't see any unexpected changes.
- Provide a PR.
- If changes are only to the Wiki, I believe you can push them
  directly using =git= or manually edit those [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/eless/wiki][here]]. /I have to yet
  figure out how to keep the non-git Wiki changes and changes in
  =eless.org= in sync./
