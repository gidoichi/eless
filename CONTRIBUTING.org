#+title: Contributing Guide
#+author: Kaushal Modi
This guide is for you if you'd like to do any of the below:
- Open an issue (plus provide debug information).
- Simply clone this repo and build =eless= locally.
- Do above + Provide a PR.
* How to help debug
- If you find =eless= not working as expected, file an [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/eless/issues][issue]].
- Include the following debug information:
  1. =emacs --version=
  2. =eless= debug info:
     - Append the =-D= option to your =eless= use case. Examples:
       - =eless foo -D=
       - =info org | eless -D=
     - If you are providing debug info for something like =man foo=, do
       - ~PAGER="eless -D" man foo~ or ~man foo | eless -D~.
* Development
** Preparation
#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/kaushalmodi/eless
#+end_src
Also see the [[*Requirements][*Requirements*]] section if you'd like to build the =eless=
script + documentation locally.
** Building =eless=
#+begin_src shell
make eless
#+end_src
*** Sanity check of the tangled =eless=
1. Run the tangled =eless= through [[https://www.shellcheck.net/][shellcheck]] to ensure that there are
   no errors.
2. Ensure that =make test= passes. Add/update tests as needed.
** Building documentation
Below will generate/update the Info manual and =README.org= and
=CONTRIBUTING.org= for Github.
#+begin_src shell
make doc
#+end_src
*** Understand the changes
- The randomly generated hyperlinks and section numbers in the Info
  document and HTML will be different.
- Other than that, you shouldn't see any unexpected changes.
** Build everything
If you'd like to build the script as well the documentation together,
you can do:
#+begin_src shell
make all
#+end_src
** Submitting PR
- You can submit a PR once you have reviewed all the changes in the
  tangled =eless= script and documentation.
- =make test= has to pass before a PR is merged.
