-----

[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/eless][*eless*]] is a combination of Bash script and a minimal emacs
=view-mode= config.

This script is designed to:

- Be portable -- Just one bash script to download to run
- Be independent of a user's emacs config
  - /You can still [[https://eless.scripter.co/#user-config-override][customize]] the =eless= config if you like./
- Not require an emacs server to be already running

It was created out of a need to have something /like/ =less= (in the
sense of /launch quickly, do, and quit/), but /better/ in these ways:

- Syntax highlighting
- Org-mode file rendering
- A better navigable man page viewer
- A better Info viewer
- Dired, especially =wdired= (batch edit symbolic links, for
  example?)
- Colored diffs, =git diff=, =git log=, =ls=, etc. (auto ANSI
  detection)
- Filter log files to only show (or not show) lines matching a regexp
- Auto-revert log files when I want (like =tail -f=)
- Quickly change frame and font sizes
- .. and more; basically everything that emacs has to offer!

I call it =eless= and here's a little taste of what it looks like:

[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/eless/master/docs/images/eless-examples.png][https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/eless/master/docs/images/eless-examples.png]]

/Shown above, starting from top left image and proceeding clock-wise../
- =eless eless.org=
- =rg --color=ansi 'man pages' | eless= (rg[[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][?]])
- =man grep= (I have set my =PAGER= env var to =eless=.)
- =info eless= (I have aliased =info= to ='\info \!* | eless'= in my
  tcsh shell.)
- =eless .= (Shows the current directory contents in =dired=.)
- =diff= of =eless.org= with an older saved version and piping the
  result to =eless=

*Meta Features*

- [X] This script passes [[http://www.shellcheck.net][ShellCheck]], and
- [X] Unofficial Bash [[http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode][strict mode]] is enabled.
- [X] Always-in-sync documentation as the =eless= script and
  documentation are generated using Org Babel from [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/eless/blob/master/eless.org][one file]] (even this
  README).
- [X] The [[https://eless.scripter.co][documentation site]] is generated on-the-fly on Netlify using
  that same /one file/.
- [X] This bash script has tests too!
* Requirements

| Software | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =emacs=  | If only *running* the =eless= script, the mininum required emacs version is 22.1 (manually tested). If *developing* (running =make all html test=), the minimum required version is *24.4* (24.4 onwards versions are auto-tested on Travis).                         |
| =bash=   | This is a =bash= script. So even if you don't use =bash= shell, you need to have the =bash= binary discoverable through your environment variable =PATH=. /Tested to work in =tcsh= shell on RHEL 6.6./                                                               |
| =perl=   | Perl is used to replace =grep -Po= and case-insensitive =sed= based replacements (using =/I=) as those features are available only in GNU versions of =grep= and =sed= (which are not present by default on /macOS/ systems). /Tested with Perl v5.16.3 on RHEL 6.6./ |
|----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

- NOTE :: If the environment variable =EMACS= is set, =eless= uses that
  as the emacs binary, else it defaults to using =emacs= as
  emacs binary.
* Try it out
Here are some usage examples:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
eless foo.txt                      # Open foo.txt in eless in terminal (-nw) mode by default.
eless foo.txt --gui                # Open foo.txt in eless in GUI mode.
echo 'foo' | eless                 #
echo 'foo' | eless -               # Same as above. The hyphen after eless does not matter; is anyways discarded.
grep 'bar' foo.txt | eless         #
diff foo bar | eless               # Colored diff!
diff -u foo bar | eless            # Colored diff for unified diff format
eless .                            # Open dired in the current directory (enhanced 'ls')
ls --color=always | eless          # Auto-detect ANSI color codes and convert those to colors
PAGER=eless git diff               # Show git diff with ANSI coded colors
eless -h | eless                   # See eless help ;-)
info emacs | eless                 # Read emacs Info manual in eless
eless foo.tar.xz                   # Read the contents of archives; emacs does the unarchiving automatically
PAGER=eless python3; help('def')   # Read (I)Python keyword help pages (example: help for 'def' keyword)
PAGER=eless python3; help('shlex') # Read (I)Python module help pages (example: help for 'shlex' module)
PAGER=eless python3; help('TYPES') # Read (I)Python topic help pages (example: help for 'TYPES' topic)
PAGER=eless man grep               # Launches man pages in eless (terminal mode), if the env var PAGER is set to eless (does not work on macOS).
PAGER=less man grep | eless        # Launches man pages in eless (terminal mode), if the env var PAGER is *not* set to eless (works on macOS).
PAGER="eless --gui" man grep       # Launches man pages in eless (GUI mode), if the env var PAGER is set to "eless --gui" (does not work on macOS).
PAGER=less man grep | eless --gui  # Launches man pages in eless (GUI mode), if the env var PAGER is *not* set to eless (works on macOS).
#+END_SRC
- NOTE :: Above examples are tested to work in a *=bash=
  shell*. Specifically, examples like ~PAGER=eless man grep~
  might need to be adapted for the shell you are using,
  [[#example-eless-config-in-bash][and also the OS]].
